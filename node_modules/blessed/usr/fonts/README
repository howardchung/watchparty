1. About.

This archive contains source code for generating and installing Terminus
Font for Linux console, BSD console and X11 Window System.

- version	4.39
- sizes		6x12, 8x14, 8x16, 10x18, 10x20, 11x22, 12x24, 14x28, 16x32
- styles	normal, bold, EGA/VGA bold
- characters	891
- format	Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF) version 2.1

The character set covers about 120 language sets and supports ISO8859-1/2/5/
7/9/13/15/16, Paratype-PT154/PT254, KOI8-R/U/E/F, Esperanto and many IBM,
Windows and Macintosh code pages, as well as the IBM VGA, vt100 and xterm
pseudographic characters.

1.1. Quick installation.

The commands:

$ ./configure [--prefix=PREFIX]
$ make
# make install fontdir

compile and install the Linux console and X11 Window System fonts.
The default PREFIX is /usr/local.

1.2. Legend.

The file names are structured as follows:

ter-u<SIZE><STYLE>.bdf

where <SIZE> is the font height, and <STYLE> is n for normal (all sizes), b
for bold (all sizes except 6x12) and v for EGA/VGA bold (8x14 and 8x16 only,
makes use of the eight character matrix column).

1.3. Variants.

Some characters are implemented in two variants. To use the alternate
variant, execute:

$ patch -p1 -i alt/<NAME>.diff

before installation. See the font page for examples about the differences.
If you want to combine hi2 with dv1 and/or ka2, apply hi2 and then hi2-dv1
and/or hi2-ka2.

1.4. Notes.

The commands marked with $ can be executed by a regular user.
The configure commands are optional.
The make commands require GNU make.

A lot of characters are available only under X11/ISO10646-1 (UTF+8/Unicode).

Sizes 6x12, 11x22, 14x28-bold and 16x32-normal are worse than the others.
Avoid them.

210E and 210F are not italic.


2. Linux console.

- sizes		all available, see "About"
- styles	normal, bold, framebuffer-bold
- code pages	ISO8859-1/ISO8859-15/Windows-1252, ISO8859-2/Windows-1250,
		Windows-1251/ISO8859-5, ISO8859-9/Windows-1254, ISO8859-16,
		ISO8859-7/Windows-1253, ISO8859-13/Windows-1257, IBM-437,
		Bulgarian-MIK, KOI8-R, KOI8-U, Paratype-PT154, combined
- format	PC Screen Font (PSF) with unicode data

2.1. consoletools.

$ ./configure [--prefix=PREFIX | --psfdir=DIRECTORY]
$ make psf
# make install-psf

The files are compressed with gzip and installed in DIRECTORY. The default
DIRECTORY is PREFIX/share/consolefonts. Requires Perl.

If you lack mappings for Windows-1252/1250/1251/1254/1253/1257, ISO8859-16,
IBM-437, KOI8-R, Bulgarian-MIK or Paratype-PT154/PT254, also run:

$ ./configure [--prefix=PREFIX | --acmdir=DIRECTORY]
$ make txt
# make install-acm

The default DIRECTORY is PREFIX/share/consoletrans. Requires awk.
Uninstallation of the mappings is not supported. To load a font:

$ consolechars [-m MAPPING] -f ter-<X><SIZE><STYLE>

where <X> is a character identifying the code page as listed in p.2.4.

2.2. kbd.

$ ./configure [--psfdir=DIRECTORY]
$ make psf
# make install-psf

where DIRECTORY should be either PREFIX/lib/kbd/consolefonts or
PREFIX/share/kbd/consolefonts, depending on kbd version. Missing mappings
are installed with:

$ ./configure [--prefix=PREFIX | --unidir=DIRECTORY]
$ make txt
# make install-uni

The default DIRECTORY is PREFIX/share/kbd/consoletrans. Requires awk. To
load a font:

$ setfont [-m MAPPING] ter-<X><SIZE><STYLE>

where <X> is a character identifying the code page as listed in p.2.4.

2.3. Quick reference.

The commands:

$ ./configure [--prefix=PREFIX | --psfdir=DIRECTORY | --ref=FILENAME]
# make install-ref

install the text from p.2.4 as FILENAME (the default is README.terminus)
in DIRECTORY.

2.4. Legend.

2.5. Notes.

The combined code page is based on IBM-437 (character 0xFF is ogonek).
The ISO8859-16 font also includes all letters and accents from Windows-1250.


3. UNIX console.

- sizes		8x14 and 8x16 only
- styles	normal, bold, framebuffer-bold
- code pages	ISO8859-1/Windows-1252, ISO8859-2, ISO8859-5, ISO8859-7,
		ISO8859-9/Windows-1254, ISO8859-13, ISO8859-15, ISO8859-16,

- format	raw data

3.1. bsd-pcvt.

$ ./configure [--prefix=PREFIX | --rawdir=DIRECTORY]
$ make raw
# make install.raw

or, for file names with minus instead of period:

# make install-raw

The default DIRECTORY is PREFIX/share/misc/pcvtfonts. The fonts are
installed uncompressed. Requires Perl. To load a font:

$ loadfont -f /usr/share/misc/pcvtfonts/ter-<X><STYLE>.8<SIZE>

or, for file names with minus instead of period:

$ loadfont -f /usr/share/misc/pcvtfonts/ter-<X><STYLE>-8x<SIZE>

where <X> is a character identifying the code page as listed in p.3.2.

3.3. Notes.

The RAW font contains data only and should be compatible with all UNIX
systems. If any of the bold fonts doesn't look good try framebuffer-bold,
or, if you are using an EGA/VGA adapter, program it to to clear column 8 of
the character matrix (attribute controller register 0x10 bit 0x02).


4. X11 Window System.

- sizes		all available, see "About"
- styles	normal, bold
- code pages	ISO8859-1/Windows-1252, ISO8859-2, ISO8859-5, ISO8859-7,
		ISO8859-9/Windows-1254, ISO8859-13, ISO8859-15, ISO8859-16,
		Windows-1251, KOI8-R, KOI8-U, Paratype-PT154, ISO10646-1
- format	Portable Compiled Font (PCF)

4.1. Installation.

$ ./configure [--prefix=PREFIX | --x11dir=DIRECTORY]
$ make pcf
# make install-pcf

The files are compressed with gzip and installed in DIRECTORY. The default
DIRECTORY is PREFIX/share/fonts/terminus. Requires Perl and bdftopcf.

A copy of the normal 6x12 font is installed as "bold", because some X11
libraries and applications substitute the missing bold fonts by shifting the
normal fonts, and others do not recognize the bold style at all if the
lowest font size lacks it. To install only the normal font, use "n12"
instead of "pcf" in the above commands.

To update the font cache in DIRECTORY after (un)installation, run:

# make fontdir

The configuration file which lists the font directories must contain
DIRECTORY. If xfs or the X-server were active during the installation, they
should be restarted so the font list can be updated.

4.2. Notes.

The ISO8859-1 and ISO8859-9 fonts contain the Windows Western characters and
can be used as Windows-1252 and Windows-1254 respectively.


5. Frequently Asked Questions.

Q. Italic version?

A. No. The quality is significantly lower, and preserving the font width
requires overlapping characters, which are not handled very well by X11/Xft.
If you need it than much, try mkitalic from FreeBSD or bdfslant from Debian.

Q. Scalable version?

A. Long story short, when the average display resolution becomes at least
150 DPI. Prefferably 200.

Q. How about some new characters?

A. Contact me and be ready to help.

Q. The bold 6x12 font...

A. ...does not exist, there is no space for a bold font in a 6x12 matrix.
However, the "normal" font is somewhere between.

Q. The font works in X11/Motif, but not in GNOME/KDE/Xfce.

A. Try adding 75-yes-terminus.conf to the Fontconfig configuration files.
See also mkfontscale(1), mkfontdir(1), fc-cache(1), xorg.conf(5), xfs(1),
xlsfonts(1), fonts-conf(5) etc.
