An effort is made to pick\r\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\r\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\r\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\r\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\r\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\r\n * primary.\r\n *\r\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\r\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\r\n * remote documents.

Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\r\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\r\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\r\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\r\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n *\r\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\r\n * longer optional.\r\n */\r\nclass IndexedDbPersistence {\r\n    constructor(\r\n    /**\r\n     * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\r\n     * access to local persistence.\r\n     */\r\n    allowTabSynchronization, persistenceKey, clientId, lruParams, queue, window, document, serializer, sequenceNumberSyncer, \r\n    /**\r\n     * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.

The Query Engine determines\r\n * what mode to use based on what data is persisted. The mode only determines\r\n * the runtime complexity of the query - the result set is equivalent across all\r\n * implementations.\r\n *\r\n * The Query engine will use indexed-based execution if a user has configured\r\n * any index that can be used to execute query (via `setIndexConfiguration()`).\r\n * Otherwise, the engine will try to optimize the query by re-using a previously\r\n * persisted query result. If that is not possible, the query will be executed\r\n * via a full collection scan.\r\n *\r\n * Index-based execution is the default when available. The query engine\r\n * supports partial indexed execution and merges the result from the index\r\n * lookup with documents that have not yet been indexed. The index evaluation\r\n * matches the backend's format and as such, the SDK can use indexing for all\r\n * queries that the backend supports.\r\n *\r\n * If no index exists, the query engine tries to take advantage of the target\r\n * document mapping in the TargetCache. These mappings exists for all queries\r\n * that have been synced with the backend at least once and allow the query\r\n * engine to only read documents that previously matched a query plus any\r\n * documents that were edited after the query was last listened to.\r\n *\r\n * There are some cases when this optimization is not guaranteed to produce\r\n * the same results as full collection scans. In these cases, query\r\n * processing falls back to full scans. These cases are:\r\n *\r\n * - Limit queries where a document that matched the query previously no longer\r\n *   matches the query.\r\n *\r\n * - Limit queries where a document edit may cause the document to sort below\r\n *   another document that is in the local cache.\r\n *\r\n * - Queries that have never been CURRENT or free of limbo documents.\r\n */\r\nclass QueryEngine {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        this.initialized = false;\r\n    }\r\n    /** Sets the document view to query against. */\r\n    initialize(localDocuments, indexManager) {\r\n        this.localDocumentsView = localDocuments;\r\n        this.indexManager = indexManager;\r\n        this.initialized = true;\r\n    }\r\n    /** Returns all local documents matching the specified query. */\r\n    getDocumentsMatchingQuery(transaction, query, lastLimboFreeSnapshotVersion, remoteKeys) {\r\n        return this.performQueryUsingIndex(transaction, query)\r\n            .next(result => result\r\n            ? result\r\n            : this.performQueryUsingRemoteKeys(transaction, query, remoteKeys, lastLimboFreeSnapshotVersion))\r\n            .next(result => result ? result : this.executeFullCollectionScan(transaction, query));\r\n    }\r\n    /**\r\n     * Performs an indexed query that evaluates the query based on a collection's\r\n     * persisted index values.
