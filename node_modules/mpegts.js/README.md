HTML5 MPEG2-TS stream player written in TypeScript & JavaScript.

mpegts.js is optimized for low-latency live stream playback, such as DVB/ISDB television or surveillance cameras.

This project is based on [flv.js](https://github.com/bilibili/flv.js).

## Overview
mpegts.js works by transmuxing MPEG2-TS stream into ISO BMFF (Fragmented MP4) segments, followed by feeding mp4 segments into an HTML5 `<video>` element through [Media Source Extensions][] API.

[Media Source Extensions]: https://w3c.github.io/media-source/

## News
- v1.7.3

    Introduced [Enhanced RTMP] with HEVC support for FLV.

    Introduced Opus and ATSC AC-3 audio codec support for MPEG-TS.

    Introduced LOAS AAC support for MPEG-TS.

- v1.7.0

    Introduced H.265/HEVC over MPEG-TS/FLV support.

[Enhanced RTMP]: https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp
## Demo
[http://xqq.github.io/mpegts.js/demo/](http://xqq.github.io/mpegts.js/demo/)

[demo with aribb24.js](http://xqq.github.io/mpegts.js/demo/arib.html)

## Features
- Playback for MPEG2-TS stream with H.264/H.265 + AAC codec transported in http(s) or WebSocket
- Playback for FLV stream with H.264/H.265 + AAC codec transported in http(s) or WebSocket
- Extremely low latency of less than 1 second in the best case
- Playback for `.m2ts` file like BDAV/BDMV with 192 bytes TS packet, or 204 bytes TS packet
- Support handling dynamic codec parameters change (e.g. video resolution change)
- Support Chrome, FireFox, Safari, Edge (Old or Chromium) or any Chromium-based browsers
- Support chasing latency automatically for internal buffer of HTMLMediaElement
- Low CPU overhead and low memory usage (JS heap takes about 10MiB for each instance)
- Support extracting PES private data (stream_type=0x06) like ARIB B24 subtitles (with [aribb24.js][])
- Support Timed ID3 Metadata (stream_type=0x15) callback (TIMED_ID3_METADATA_ARRIVED)

## CORS
If you use standalone video server for MPEG2-TS stream, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header must be configured correctly on video server for cross-origin resource fetching.

See [cors.md](docs/cors.md) for more details.

## Installation
```bash
npm install --save mpegts.js
```

## Build
```bash
npm install                 # install dev-dependencies
npm install -g webpack-cli  # install build tool
npm run build               # packaged & minimized js will be emitted in dist folder
```

[cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm) mirror is recommended if you are in Mainland China.

## Getting Started
```html
<script src="mpegts.js"></script>
<video id="videoElement"></video>
<script>
    if (mpegts.getFeatureList().mseLivePlayback) {
        var videoElement = document.getElementById('videoElement');
        var player = mpegts.createPlayer({
            type: 'mse',  // could also be mpegts, m2ts, flv
            isLive: true,
            url: 'http://example.com/live/livestream.ts'
        });
        player.attachMediaElement(videoElement);
        player.load();
        player.play();
    }
</script>
```
mpegts.js could be tested with [Simple Realtime Server](https://github.com/ossrs/srs/).

## TODO
- MPEG2-TS static file playback (seeking is not supported now)
- MP3/AC3 audio codec support
- AV1/OPUS codec over MPEG2-TS stream support (?)

## Limitations
- mpeg2video is not supported
- HTTP MPEG2-TS live stream could not work on old browsers like IE11
- mpegts.js is not usable on iOS version 17.0 or older caused by the banning of [Media Source Extensions][] (available on iPadOS), iOS 17.1 works through Managed Media Source API

## Features inherited from flv.js
- FLV container with H.264 + AAC / MP3 codec playback
- Multipart segmented video playback
- HTTP FLV low latency live stream playback
- FLV over WebSocket live stream playback
- Compatible with Chrome, FireFox, Safari 10, IE11 and Edge
- Extremely low overhead, and hardware accelerated by your browser!

## FLV playback limitations
- MP3 audio codec is currently not working on IE11 / Edge
- HTTP FLV live stream is not currently working on all browsers, see [livestream.md](docs/livestream.md)

## FLV Multipart playback
You only have to provide a playlist for `MediaDataSource`. See [multipart.md](docs/multipart.md)

## Livestream playback
See [livestream.md](docs/livestream.md)

## API and Configuration
See [api.md](docs/api.md)

## Debug
```bash
npm install                 # install dev-dependencies
npm install -g webpack-cli  # install build tool
npm run build:debug         # packaged & minimized js will be emitted in dist folder
```
