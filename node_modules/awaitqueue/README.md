TypeScript utility to enqueue asynchronous tasks and run them sequentially one after another. For Node.js and the browser.

## Installation

```bash
npm install awaitqueue
```

## Usage

In ESM:

```ts
import {
	AwaitQueue,
	AwaitQueuePushOptions,
	AwaitQueueTask,
	AwaitQueueTaskDump,
	AwaitQueueStoppedError,
	AwaitQueueRemovedTaskError,
} from 'awaitqueue';
```

Using CommonJS:

```ts
const {
	AwaitQueue,
	AwaitQueuePushOptions,
	AwaitQueueTask,
	AwaitQueueTaskDump,
	AwaitQueueStoppedError,
	AwaitQueueRemovedTaskError,
} = require('awaitqueue');
```

## Types

### `type AwaitQueuePushOptions`

```ts
export type AwaitQueuePushOptions = {
	removeOngoingTasksWithSameName?: boolean;
};
```

Options given to `awaitQueue.push()`.

- `removeOngoingTasksWithSameName`: If `true`, all previously enqueued tasks with same name will be removed and will reject with an instance of `AwaitQueueRemovedTaskError`.

### `type AwaitQueueTask`

```ts
type AwaitQueueTask<T> = () => T | PromiseLike<T>;
```

TypeScript type representing a function that returns a value `T` or a Promise that resolves with `T`.

### `type AwaitQueueTaskDump`

```ts
type AwaitQueueTaskDump = {
	idx: number;
	task: AwaitQueueTask<unknown>;
	name?: string;
	enqueuedTime: number;
	executionTime: number;
};
```

TypeScript type representing an item in the array returned by the `awaitQueue.dump()` method.

- `idx`: Index of the pending task in the queue (0 means the task being processed now).
- `task`: The function to be executed.
- `name`: The name of the given `function` (if any) or the `name` argument given to `awaitQueue.push()` method (if any).
- `enqueuedTime`: Time in milliseconds since the task was enqueued, this is, since `awaitQueue.push()` was called until its execution started or until now if not yet started.
- `executionTime`: Time in milliseconds since the task execution started (or 0 if not yet started).

## API

### Class `AwaitQueue`

```ts
const awaitQueue = new AwaitQueue();
```

#### Getter `awaitQueue.size`

```ts
size: number;
```

Number of enqueued pending tasks in the queue (including the running one if any).

#### Method `awaitQueue.push()`

```ts
async push<T>(task: AwaitQueueTask<T>, name?: string, options?: AwaitQueuePushOptions): Promise<T>
```

Accepts a task as argument and enqueues it after pending tasks. Once processed, the `push()` method resolves (or rejects) with the result (or error) returned by the given task.

- `@param task`: Asynchronous or asynchronous function.
- `@param name`: Optional task name.
- `@param.options`: Options.

#### Method `awaitQueue.stop()`

```ts
stop(): void
```

Makes all pending tasks reject with an instance of `AwaitQueueStoppedError`. The `AwaitQueue` instance is still usable for future tasks added via `push()` method.

#### Method `awaitQueue.remove()`

```ts
remove(taskIdx: number): void
```

Removes the pending task with given index. The task is rejected with an instance of `AwaitQueueRemovedTaskError`.

- `@param taskIdx`: Index of the pending task to be removed.

#### Method `awaitQueue.dump()`

```ts
dump(): AwaitQueueTaskDump[]
```

Returns an array with information about pending tasks in the queue. See the `AwaitQueueTaskDump` type above.

### Class `AwaitQueueStoppedError`

Custom `Error` derived class used to reject pending tasks once `awaitQueue.stop()` method has been called.

### Class `AwaitQueueRemovedTaskError`

Custom `Error` derived class used to reject pending tasks once `awaitQueue.remove()` method has been called.

## Usage examples

See the [unit tests](src/tests/test.ts).
