# An onClickOutside wrapper for React components

This is a React Higher Order Component (HOC) that you can use with your own
React components if you want to have them listen for clicks that occur somewhere
in the document, outside of the element itself (for instance, if you need to
hide a menu when people click anywhere else on your page).

Note that this HOC relies on the `.classList` property, which is supported by
all modern browsers, but not by deprecated and obsolete browsers like IE (noting
that Microsoft Edge is not Microsoft Internet Explorer. Edge does not have any
problems with the `classList` property for SVG elements). If your code relies on
classList in any way, you want to use a polyfill like
[dom4](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4).

This HOC supports stateless components as of v5.7.0, and switched to using
transpiled es6 classes rather than `createClass` as of v6.

## Installation

Use `npm`:

```
$> npm install react-onclickoutside --save
```

(or `--save-dev` depending on your needs). You then use it in your components
as:


## Usage

### ES6 Class Component

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  handleClickOutside = evt => {
    // ..handling code goes here...
  };
}

export default onClickOutside(MyComponent);
```

### Functional Component with UseState Hook

This HoC does not support functional components, as it relies on class properties and component instances. However, you almost certainly don't need this HoC in modern (React 16+) functional component code, as a simple function will do the trick just fine. E.g.:

```js
function listenForOutsideClicks(listening, setListening, menuRef, setIsOpen) {
  return () => {
    if (listening) return;
    if (!menuRef.current) return;
    setListening(true);
    [`click`, `touchstart`].forEach((type) => {
      document.addEventListener(`click`, (evt) => {
        if (menuRef.current.contains(evt.target)) return;
        setIsOpen(false);
      });
    });
  }
}
```

Used in a functional component as:

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState, useRef } from "react";
import listenForOutsideClicks from "./somewhere";

const Menu = () => {
  const menuRef = useRef(null);
  const [listening, setListening] = useState(false);
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);  
  const toggle = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);

  useEffect(listenForOutsideClick(
    listening,
    setListening,
    menuRef,
    setIsOpen,
  ));

  return (
    <div ref={menuRef} className={isOpen ? "open" : "hidden"}>
      <h1 onClick={toggle}>...</h1>
      <ul>...</ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Menu;
```

### CommonJS Require

```js
// .default is needed because library is bundled as ES6 module
var onClickOutside = require("react-onclickoutside").default;
var createReactClass = require("create-react-class");

// create a new component, wrapped by this onclickoutside HOC:
var MyComponent = onClickOutside(
  createReactClass({
    // ...,
    handleClickOutside: function(evt) {
      // ...handling code goes here...
    }
    // ...
  })
);
```

### Ensuring there is a click handler

Note that if you try to wrap a React component class without a
`handleClickOutside(evt)` handler like this, the HOC will throw an error. In
order to use a custom event handler, you can specify the function to be used by
the HOC as second parameter (this can be useful in environments like TypeScript,
where the fact that the wrapped component does not implement the handler can be
flagged at compile-time):

```js
// load the HOC:
import React, { Component } from "react";
import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";

// create a new component, wrapped below by onClickOutside HOC:
class MyComponent extends Component {
  // ...
  myClickOutsideHandler(evt) {
    // ...handling code goes here...
  }
  // ...
}
var clickOutsideConfig = {
  handleClickOutside: function(instance) {
    return instance.myClickOutsideHandler;
  }
};
var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent, clickOutsideConfig);
```

Note that if you try to wrap a React component with a custom handler that the
component does not implement, the HOC will throw an error at run-time.

## Regulate which events to listen for

By default, "outside clicks" are based on both `mousedown` and `touchstart`
events; if that is what you need, then you do not need to specify anything
special. However, if you need different events, you can specify these using the
`eventTypes` property. If you just need one event, you can pass in the event
name as plain string:

```js
<MyComponent eventTypes="click" ... />
```

For multiple events, you can pass in the array of event names you need to listen
for:

```js
<MyComponent eventTypes={["click", "touchend"]} ... />
```

## Regulate whether or not to listen for outside clicks

Wrapped components have two functions that can be used to explicitly listen for,
or do nothing with, outside clicks

* `enableOnClickOutside()` - Enables outside click listening by setting up the
  event listening bindings.
* `disableOnClickOutside()` - Disables outside click listening by explicitly
  removing the event listening bindings.

In addition, you can create a component that uses this HOC such that it has the
code set up and ready to go, but not listening for outside click events until
you explicitly issue its `enableOnClickOutside()`, by passing in a properly
called `disableOnClickOutside`:

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  // ...
  handleClickOutside(evt) {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent);

class Container extends Component {
  render(evt) {
    return <EnhancedComponent disableOnClickOutside={true} />;
  }
}
```

Using `disableOnClickOutside()` or `enableOnClickOutside()` within
`componentDidMount` or `componentWillMount` is considered an anti-pattern, and
does not have consistent behaviour when using the mixin and HOC/ES7 Decorator.
Favour setting the `disableOnClickOutside` property on the component.

## Regulate whether or not to listen to scrollbar clicks

By default this HOC will listen for "clicks inside the document", which may
include clicks that occur on the scrollbar. Quite often clicking on the
scrollbar _should_ close whatever is open but in case your project invalidates
that assumption you can use the `excludeScrollbar` property to explicitly tell
the HOC that clicks on the scrollbar should be ignored:

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  // ...
}
var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent);

class Container extends Component {
  render(evt) {
    return <EnhancedComponent excludeScrollbar={true} />;
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can specify this behavior as default for all instances of
your component passing a configuration object as second parameter:

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  // ...
}
var clickOutsideConfig = {
  excludeScrollbar: true
};
var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent, clickOutsideConfig);
```

## Regulating `evt.preventDefault()` and `evt.stopPropagation()`

Technically this HOC lets you pass in `preventDefault={true/false}` and
`stopPropagation={true/false}` to regulate what happens to the event when it
hits your `handleClickOutside(evt)` function, but beware: `stopPropagation` may
not do what you expect it to do.

Each component adds new event listeners to the document, which may or may not
cause as many event triggers as there are event listening bindings. In the test
file found in `./test/browser/index.html`, the coded uses
`stopPropagation={true}` but sibling events still make it to "parents".

## Marking elements as "skip over this one" during the event loop

If you want the HOC to ignore certain elements, you can tell the HOC which CSS
class name it should use for this purposes. If you want explicit control over
the class name, use `outsideClickIgnoreClass={some string}` as component
property, or if you don't, the default string used is
`ignore-react-onclickoutside`.

## Older React code: "What happened to the Mixin??"

Due to ES2015/ES6 `class` syntax making mixins essentially impossible, and the
fact that HOC wrapping works perfectly fine in ES5 and older versions of React,
as of this package's version 5.0.0 no Mixin is offered anymore.

If you _absolutely_ need a mixin... you really don't.

### But how can I access my component? It has an API that I rely on!

No, I get that. I constantly have that problem myself, so while there is no
universal agreement on how to do that, this HOC offers a `getInstance()`
function that you can call for a reference to the component you wrapped, so that
you can call its API without headaches:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import onClickOutside from 'react-onclickoutside'

class MyComponent extends Component {
  // ...
  handleClickOutside(evt) {
    // ...
  }
  ...
}
var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent);

class Container extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.getMyComponentRef = this.getMyComponentRef.bind(this);
  }

  someFunction() {
    var ref = this.myComponentRef;
    // 1) Get the wrapped component instance:
    var superTrueMyComponent = ref.getInstance();
    // and call instance functions defined for it:
    superTrueMyComponent.customFunction();
  }

  getMyComponentRef(ref) {
    this.myComponentRef = ref;
  }

  render(evt) {
    return <EnhancedComponent disableOnClickOutside={true} ref={this.getMyComponentRef}/>
  }
}
```

Note that there is also a `getClass()` function, to get the original Class that
was passed into the HOC wrapper, but if you find yourself needing this you're
probably doing something wrong: you really want to define your classes as real,
require'able etc. units, and then write wrapped components separately, so that
you can always access the original class's `statics` etc. properties without
needing to extract them out of a HOC.

## Which version do I need for which version of React?

If you use **React 0.12 or 0.13**, **version 2.4 and below** will work.

If you use **React 0.14**, use **v2.5 through v4.9**, as these specifically use
`react-DOM` for the necessary DOM event bindings.

If you use **React 15**, you can use **v4.x, which offers both a mixin and HOC,
or use v5.x, which is HOC-only**.

If you use **React 15.5**, you can use **v5.11.x**, which relies on
`createClass` as supplied by `create-react-class` rather than
`React.createClass`.

If you use **React 16** or 15.5 in preparation of 16, use v6.x, which uses pure
class notation.

### Support-wise, only the latest version will receive updates and bug fixes.

I do not believe in perpetual support for outdated libraries, so if you find one
of the older versions is not playing nice with an even older React: you know
what to do, and it's not "keep using that old version of React".

## IE does not support classList for SVG elements!

This is true, but also an edge-case problem that only exists for IE11 (as all
versions prior to 11 [no longer exist](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17454/lifecycle-faq-internet-explorer)), and should be addressed by you, rather
than by thousands of individual libraries that assume browsers have proper
HTML API  implementations (IE Edge has proper `classList` support even for SVG).

If you need this to work, you can add a shim for `classList` to your page(s),
loaded before you load your React code, and you'll have instantly fixed _every_
library that you might remotely rely on that makes use of the `classList`
property. You can find several shims quite easily, a good one to start with is
the [dom4](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4) shim, which adds all manner of
good DOM4 properties to "not quite at DOM4 yet" browser implementations.

Eventually this problem will stop being one, but in the mean time _you_ are
responsible for making _your_ site work by shimming everything that needs
shimming for IE. As such, **if you file a PR to fix classList-and-SVG issues
specifically for this library, your PR will be closed and I will politely point
you to this README.md section**. I will not accept PRs to fix this issue. You
already have the power to fix it, and I expect you to take responsibility as a
fellow developer to shim what you need instead of getting obsolete quirks
supported by libraries whose job isn't to support obsolete quirks.

To work around the issue you can use this simple shim:

```js
if (!("classList" in SVGElement.prototype)) {
  Object.defineProperty(SVGElement.prototype, "classList", {
    get() {
      return {
        contains: className => {
          return this.className.baseVal.split(" ").indexOf(className) !== -1;
        }
      };
    }
  });
}
```

## I can't find what I need in the README

If you've read the whole thing and you still can't find what you were looking
for, then the README is missing important information that should be added in.
Please [file an issue](https://github.com/Pomax/react-onclickoutside/issues) with a request for additional documentation,
describing what you were hoping to find in enough detail that it can be used to
write up the information you needed.
